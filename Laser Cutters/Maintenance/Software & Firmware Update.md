# Updating Firmware/Software on the Trotec Speed 400 Flexx Lasers
Required when: Issues with not being able to connect, laser not responding to controls, lack of movement in one or more axes

Updating software (JobControl):
1. Download latest [JobControl](https://www.troteclaser.com/en-us/learn-support/download-area/software-jobcontrol?source_campaign=70158000000Y8MV&gclid=Cj0KCQjwnbmaBhD-ARIsAGTPcfUaI9yNWop3vpfEWSklB-vjmmpWJz8a1qtv5KCMXN_rZcgVaEGdomMaAonlEALw_wcB) software from Trotec's website
2. Unzip the downloaded file
3. Find and run start.exe

Updating firmware:
1. Turn the laser off and open the lid
2. Start the laser with the lid still open. This stops the laser from running its homing sequence, which may avoid some errors caused by not up-to-date firmware
3. Open JobControl and connect to the laser
4. In JobControl click on "Settings" then "Update Firmware"
5. Click on load and select the correct firmware file for your machine. The firmware files can be found in the JobControl download linked above, in the "\_Firmware" folder. 
6. Click on connect, then send once connected
7. Wait for the file transfer to complete, then close the lid and restart your laser. 
8. After a machine restart, should run normally.
