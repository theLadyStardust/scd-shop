# Bed Sweep
Required when: Significant buildup underneath bed or once/week

Regularly cleaning underneath the bed stops the filtration system from degrading due to dust/small pieces building up. This also prevents fires from starting beneath the bed if the laser hits a small scrap piece.

Cleaning out underneath the bed: 
1. With laser off, open lid
2. Move the carriage to the back of the laser
4. Press pins on back-left and front-right corners of bed so that they are loose in their sockets
5. Gripping the bed by the sides, gently lift it out of the laser. Set aside.
6. Using a shop vac or by hand, clean out dust and scraps that have fallen through
7. Replace bed, depressing pins so they lock in place
8. Close laser
