# Lens & Mirror Cleaning
The lens and mirrors of the laser are the most fragile part of its systems, and one of the most key. Cleaning each regularly is necessary to keep the laser in good shape, as dust collected on the lens or one of the mirrors can light on fire and damage the reflective coating on each, dimishing the effectiveness of the laser. The laser has 1 lens and 4 mirrors that need to be cleaned, all in various locations. **When cleaning, removing, or in any way interacting with optical equipment, do not touch reflective surfaces.** The oils on your hands can and will damage them if given the chance. Handle these parts with care. 

## The Carriage
The carriage carries the lens and a mirror to direct the beamline into the lens across the laser's bed. Since these both are unavoidably in the laser area, they're not as well protected from the dust thrown up during operation. This means they need to be checked everyday for dust, and cleaned if there is buildup. 

### Getting access to the Lens
The lens is held in place by a collar on the bottom side of the carriage. 
1. Turn the laser off
2. Be sure you have the Laser maintenance kit from the staff cabinet, with a sheet of lens paper and the bottle of lens cleaner open and at hand. 
3. Unscrew the collar, and, gripping the lens holder by its sides, slide it out. 

### The Cleaning Process
1. Be sure you have the lens cleaner and lens paper available, with the bottle of lens cleaner open. These can be found in the laser maintenance kits in the staff cabinet
2. Check to see if the surface needs cleaning. If there are visible specks of dust or debris on the lens or mirror, it needs cleaning. Otherwise, don't. Over cleaning can result in a scratched or otherwise damaged surface. 
3. Taking care to not touch the lens with your skin, drop 2-3 drops of lens cleaner onto the lens or mirror
4. Gently press the lens paper against the lens or mirror and, starting at the center, use a spiral pattern to pick up dust and move it to the outside. 

### Carriage Mirror
1. Unscrew the thumbscrews on top of the carriage
2. Carefully lift the mirror out by its sides, taking caution to not drop the thumbscrews into the bed. 
3. Without touching the mirror, turn it over, then follow the cleaning process detailed above. 
4. Carefully set the mirror back into its place, then screw the thumbscrews back in. 

## The Gantry and Stationary Mirrors
The gantry carries with it a mirror on the right side of the machine, accessible via the maintenance hatch on that side. The other two mirrors are also accessible from that hatch. 
1. Ensure the machine is turned off
2. Using the largest allen key found in the maintenance kit, open the maintenance panel on the right-hand side of the machine. 
3. Locate the gantry mirror. It should be attached to the carriage and in a metal housing with two thumbscrews attaching it to the housing
4. Undo those thumbscrews and remove the mirror
5. Clean it following the above process.
6. Replace the mirror and screw the thumbscrews back in place. 
7. Locate the other two mirrors in that side. 
8. Clean them following the above process.
